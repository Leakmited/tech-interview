# 🧪 Leakmited Python Tests

Welcome! 👋

We're excited to get to know you through this short technical challenge. These exercises are designed to spark a conversation between you and the Leakmited team. There’s no perfect solution — we’re not looking for trick answers, just a glimpse into how you think, structure code, and approach problems.

Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, we're eager to see your perspective.

## ⚙️ Pre-requisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) – for dependency management (fast alternative to pip)
- [**Docker & Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) – for containerized environments

## 📚 Overview of the Tests

Each test is focused on a different skill set. Feel free to tackle them in order or prioritize based on your strengths. What matters most is clarity, structure, and clean reasoning.

### ✅ Test 1: SQL Logic
Show us how you think with relational data. You’ll write simple queries and demonstrate your understanding of joins, filters, and aggregates.

### 🧠 Test 2: Python Data Transformation
You’ll manipulate and clean data using core Python concepts. This is a great place to show your comfort with data structures, logic, and readability.

### 🌐 Test 3: API Data Fetching
This quick task evaluates how you interact with external APIs and handle JSON data. It's short and fun — think of it as a mini project with real-world flavor.

## 📝 Submission Tips

- There are **no right or wrong answers**, but we do care about:
  - Code readability and structure
  - Reasoning and approach
  - Your ability to communicate clearly in code and comments

- If something’s unclear, feel free to make assumptions — just explain them briefly.
