### **Exercise 2: Clean the Network**
Remove all pipes marked as abandoned (`Abandoned == 1`) from the network.

---

### **Exercise 3: Merge Leak Data**
Merge the cleaned pipe network with leak records using pipe identifiers.

---

### **Exercise 4: Compute Material Usage by Type**
For each usage category of pipe, compute the percentage share of each material used.
